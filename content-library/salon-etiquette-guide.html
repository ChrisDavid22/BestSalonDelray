                salon etiquette ensures you get the best possible service while respecting the professionals caring
                for your hair. This comprehensive guide covers everything from booking and arriving to tipping and
                handling disappointments. Consider this your insider's manual to navigating salon culture in Delray
                Beach with confidence and grace.

        <div class="article-block">
            <h2>Booking Your Appointment</h2>

            <div class="etiquette-card">
                <h4>How Far in Advance to Book</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Regular haircut:</strong> 1-2 weeks ahead</li>
                    <li><strong>Color service:</strong> 2-3 weeks ahead</li>
                    <li><strong>Special events (weddings, proms):</strong> 4-8 weeks ahead</li>
                    <li><strong>Popular stylists or peak times:</strong> 3-4 weeks ahead</li>
                    <li><strong>Last-minute availability:</strong> Call and ask—you might get lucky with a cancellation</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <h3>What to Communicate When Booking</h3>
            <p>
                Be specific about what you want so the receptionist can allocate appropriate time and book you with
                the right stylist:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>"I need a haircut and partial highlights"—not just "haircut"</li>
                <li>"I want to go from brown to blonde"—this requires extra time</li>
                <li>"I have very thick, curly hair"—affects timing</li>
                <li>"This is my first time there"—they may build in consultation time</li>
                <li>"I'm on a tight schedule and need to leave by 2pm"—helps them plan</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="tip-box">
                <strong>Pro Tip:</strong> If you're unsure what service you need, it's okay to say "I'm not sure if I
                need highlights or balayage—can I discuss with the stylist?" The receptionist can note this and ensure
                adequate time for consultation.
            </div>

            <h3>Requesting Specific Stylists</h3>
            <p>
                It's perfectly acceptable to request a specific stylist, whether based on recommendations, their
                portfolio, or previous experience with them. However, be flexible if they're booked—you might discover
                a new favorite stylist.
            </p>

            <blockquote>
                "I've been going to Rové for years, but my regular stylist went on maternity leave. The receptionist
                recommended someone else on the team with a similar style. Turns out, she's amazing—sometimes change
                leads you to exactly what you needed." — Maria T., Delray Beach
            </blockquote>
        </div>

        <div class="article-block">
            <h2>Arrival and Preparation</h2>

            <h3>Timing Your Arrival</h3>
            <div class="etiquette-card">
                <h4>The 10-Minute Rule</h4>
                <p>
                    Arrive 10 minutes early for your first visit (to complete paperwork) or 5 minutes early for
                    regular appointments. This gives you time to check in, use the restroom, and settle in without
                    rushing. However, arriving more than 15 minutes early can actually inconvenience the salon if
                    they're not ready for you yet.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="important-note">
                <h4>Running Late?</h4>
                <p>
                    Call immediately if you're going to be more than 5 minutes late. Salons often have back-to-back
                    appointments, and 15+ minutes late might mean your appointment needs to be shortened or rescheduled.
                    Most salons are understanding of occasional lateness, but chronic tardiness affects other clients
                    and your stylist's schedule.
                </p>
            </div>

                        <li>Clean, dry hair (unless instructed otherwise)</li>
                        <li>Hair free of heavy products or oils</li>
                        <li>Reference photos saved on your phone</li>
                        <li>Any hair accessories you want incorporated</li>
                        <li>Your usual styling products (if discussing home care)</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                <div class="dont-column">

                        <li>Hair in a tight bun or ponytail (leaves dents)</li>
                        <li>Heavy perfume or fragrance (salons have strong smells already)</li>
                        <li>Unrealistic expectations and no flexibility</li>
                        <li>A bad attitude if you're having a rough day</li>
                    </ul>

        <div class="article-block">
            <h2>During Your Appointment</h2>

            <h3>The Consultation</h3>
            <p>
                This is the most important part of your appointment. A good consultation ensures you and your stylist
                are on the same page.
            </p>

            <div class="etiquette-card">
                <h4>How to Communicate Effectively</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Show, don't just tell:</strong> Bring multiple photos showing what you like</li>
                    <li><strong>Be specific about what you like:</strong> "I love the length but not the color" helps
                    your stylist understand</li>
                    <li><strong>Be honest about your routine:</strong> If you won't style your hair daily, say so</li>
                    <li><strong>Disclose your hair history:</strong> Previous color, chemical treatments, recent cuts</li>
                    <li><strong>Ask questions:</strong> "Will this work with my hair type?" "How often will I need
                    touch-ups?"</li>
                    <li><strong>Listen to professional advice:</strong> If your stylist suggests modifications, hear
                    them out</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <h3>Speaking Up During Service</h3>
            <p>
                It's your hair. If something feels wrong, speak up immediately:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>If they're cutting more than you wanted, say so now (not after it's done)</li>
                <li>If the color looks wrong during processing, mention it</li>
                <li>If something hurts or feels uncomfortable, tell them</li>
                <li>If you don't understand what they're doing, ask</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="scenario-box">
                <h4>How to Phrase Concerns</h4>
                <p><strong>Instead of:</strong> "That's not what I wanted!"<br>
                <strong>Try:</strong> "I'm a little concerned about the length—can we pause and make sure we're on the
                same page?"</p>

                <p><strong>Instead of:</strong> "You're doing it wrong!"<br>
                <strong>Try:</strong> "Can you help me understand what technique you're using here? I want to make sure
                it achieves what we discussed."</p>
            </div>

            <h3>Phone and Device Etiquette</h3>
            <p>
                This varies by preference, but general guidelines:

            <ul>
                <li>Checking your phone quietly is fine</li>
                <li>Taking calls should be brief or taken outside (especially during consultation)</li>
                <li>If you need to take an important call, let your stylist know</li>
                <li>Don't FaceTime or watch videos without headphones</li>
                <li>It's okay to prefer quiet time—you don't have to chat the whole time</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Bringing Children</h3>
            <p>
                Unless your child is also receiving services, it's generally best to arrange childcare. Salons have
                chemicals, hot tools, and sharp implements that aren't safe for unsupervised children. If you must
                bring a child:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>Call ahead and ask if it's okay</li>
                <li>Bring activities to keep them occupied</li>
                <li>Don't let them run around or touch products/equipment</li>
                <li>Consider rescheduling if your child is sick or very fussy</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Tipping: The Complete Guide</h2>

            <p>
                Tipping in salons can feel confusing, but it's an important part of the industry. Here's everything
                you need to know about tipping in Delray Beach salons:
            </p>

            <h3>Standard Tipping Rates</h3>

            <div class="price-guide">
                <table>
                    <tr>
                        <th>Service Provider</th>
                        <th>Standard Tip</th>
                        <th>Exceptional Service</th>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td><strong>Your stylist</strong></td>
                        <td>20%</td>
                        <td>25-30%</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td><strong>Colorist (if different person)</strong></td>
                        <td>20%</td>
                        <td>25%</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td><strong>Shampoo assistant</strong></td>
                        <td>$5-$10</td>
                        <td>$10-$15</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td><strong>Blow-dry assistant</strong></td>
                        <td>$10-$15</td>
                        <td>$15-$20</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td><strong>Salon owner (who does your service)</strong></td>
                        <td>15-20% (optional but appreciated)</td>
                        <td>20-25%</td>
                    </tr>
                </table>
            </div>

            <h3>Special Tipping Situations</h3>

            <div class="scenario-box">
                <h4>Scenario: Holiday Appointments</h4>
                <p>
                    During holiday season (Thanksgiving through New Year's), consider increasing your tip to 25-30%
                    or giving a holiday bonus equivalent to one service cost for your regular stylist.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="scenario-box">
                <h4>Scenario: The Service Wasn't Perfect</h4>
                <p>
                    If there was a minor issue but the stylist tried their best and was professional, still tip 15-20%.
                    If there was a major issue and the salon corrected it free of charge, tip on the original service
                    price. If you're truly unhappy and don't plan to return, 10-15% acknowledges their time.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="scenario-box">
                <h4>Scenario: You Got a Discount or Promotion</h4>
                <p>
                    Tip based on the original price, not the discounted price. Your stylist did the same work—they
                    shouldn't earn less because you used a coupon.
                </p>
            </div>

            <h3>Cash vs. Card Tipping</h3>
            <p>
                Cash is often preferred because stylists receive it immediately and in full (some salons take a
                percentage of card tips for processing). However, if you don't have cash, card tips are perfectly
                acceptable. Most modern salons allow you to split tips between multiple service providers when paying
                by card.
            </p>

            <div class="tip-box">
                <strong>Can't afford to tip?</strong> If budget is tight, it's better to book less expensive services
                that you can tip appropriately for rather than booking premium services without tipping. Stylists rely
                on tips as a significant portion of their income.

            <h2>Cancellations and No-Shows</h2>

            <h3>Cancellation Policies</h3>
            <p>
                Most Delray Beach salons require 24-48 hours notice for cancellations. This is because:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>Your stylist loses income from that time slot</li>
                <li>Another client could have booked that time</li>
                <li>The salon still has operating costs</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="important-note">
                <h4>Late Cancellation Fees</h4>
                <p>
                    Many salons charge 50-100% of the service cost for late cancellations or no-shows. While this
                    might feel harsh, remember that your stylist set aside their time and turned away other clients.
                    If you have a legitimate emergency, call and explain—most salons will work with you once, but
                    chronic late cancellations may result in requiring deposits for future bookings.
                </p>
            </div>

            <h3>How to Cancel Properly</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Call as soon as you know you need to cancel (not text or email)</li>
                <li>Explain briefly but don't over-explain</li>
                <li>Ask to reschedule immediately if you still want the service</li>
                <li>If you can't reschedule right away, call back within a few days to rebook</li>
            </ol>
        </div>

        <div class="article-block">
            <h2>When You're Unhappy with Results</h2>

            <h3>Immediate Issues (Day of Service)</h3>
            <p>
                If you notice something wrong before leaving the salon, speak up immediately. It's much easier to fix
                issues right then than after you've left. Say something like:
            </p>

            <blockquote>
                "Before I go, I'm noticing the color looks a bit more [orange/brassy/dark] than we discussed. Can we
                adjust it?"
            </blockquote>

            <h3>Issues You Notice Later</h3>
            <p>
                If you get home and realize something is wrong, call the salon within 24-48 hours. Most salons will
                offer to fix issues free of charge if you bring them up promptly.
            </p>

            <div class="dos-donts">
                <div class="do-column">

                    <ul>
                        <li>Call and explain the issue calmly</li>
                        <li>Give them a chance to fix it</li>
                        <li>Bring photos of what you wanted vs what you got</li>
                        <li>Be specific about what's wrong</li>
                        <li>Accept that some things take time (color fading, for example)</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                <div class="dont-column">
                    <h4>Don't:</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Trash them on social media before giving them a chance to fix it</li>
                        <li>Try to fix it yourself (especially color)</li>
                        <li>Wait weeks to complain</li>
                        <li>Demand a refund for something fixable</li>
                        <li>Be abusive to the receptionist or staff</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
            </div>

            <h3>When to Move On</h3>
            <p>
                If a salon fixes an issue once and you're happy, great. If they've messed up multiple times despite
                good communication, or if they're unwilling to fix clear mistakes, it's time to find a new salon.
                Leave an honest but professional review and move on.

            <h2>Building a Relationship with Your Stylist</h2>

            <h3>Loyalty Benefits</h3>
            <p>
                Having a regular stylist who knows your hair history provides better results over time. They:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>Remember what you like and don't like</li>
                <li>Track how your hair responds to different treatments</li>

            <p>
                This can feel awkward, but it's your right to find the best match for you. If you want to try someone
                new at the same salon:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>You don't need permission or an elaborate excuse</li>
                <li>Simply book with the new stylist—the receptionist won't make it weird</li>
                <li>If you run into your old stylist, a friendly "trying something new!" is fine</li>
                <li>Don't bad-mouth your previous stylist to the new one</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Special Situations</h2>

            <h3>First-Time Salon Visits</h3>
            <p>
                If you're nervous about your first "real" salon experience, that's completely normal. Consider:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>Booking a simple service first (haircut) before complex color</li>
                <li>Telling the receptionist it's your first visit so they can guide you</li>
                <li>Asking questions—no question is too basic</li>
                <li>Reading reviews to find salons known for welcoming new clients</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Medical Considerations</h3>
            <p>
                Always inform your stylist if you:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>Are pregnant or nursing (affects which products are safe)</li>
                <li>Are undergoing chemotherapy or have had recent hair loss</li>
                <li>Have scalp conditions or allergies</li>
                <li>Take medications that affect hair or skin</li>
                <li>Have mobility issues that affect how you sit</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                Professional stylists are trained to accommodate these situations and will appreciate knowing ahead
                of time.

            <h2>Delray Beach-Specific Considerations</h2>

            <h3>Seasonal Booking</h3>
            <p>
                Delray Beach's "season" (roughly November-April) brings an influx of residents and visitors, making
                salons busier. Book further in advance during these months, especially around holidays.
            </p>

            <h3>Event Season</h3>
            <p>
                Prom season (April-May), wedding season (December-April), and snowbird season mean heightened demand.
                Plan accordingly if you have flexibility in timing.
            </p>

            <h3>Parking</h3>
            <p>
                Downtown Delray parking can be challenging. Factor in extra time to find parking, especially for
                salons on Atlantic Avenue. Some salons validate parking—ask when booking.
